pubcrawl app to save your location
I'm currently living near Venice, and people around here likes to practice the pub crawl (baccar√≥) quite often, but the best bars in Italy are usually without names and it's very hard to find the location on google map. So I create this web application where you can save the places that you visited and rank it, so the next time you are there you can know exactly where to go
html-css-javascript
function, arrays and OOP, using geolocation API, using third party leaflet library, rendering form, refractoring.
